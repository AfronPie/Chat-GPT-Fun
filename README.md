# Summary
The actual code was taken entirely from https://github.com/techleadhd/chatgpt-retrieval (and only very very slightly modified to be used in this scenario). 
I saw a great video on Youtube about how you can customize Chat GPT and input your own .txt files in and have it use it's LLM intelligence to answer.
There was an Chat GPT/AI day at my company, so I created this custom chat bot to see how well Chat GPT would function in this respect.
