What is a Traditional IRA?
The Mutual of America Traditional IRA, a variable annuity contract, provides certain tax advantages when you set aside a portion of your earnings to build your retirement income. IRAs are individually owned variable annuity contracts that are available to all working and self-employed people, and they do not require employer sponsorship. If you satisfy certain income requirements, your contributions to a Traditional IRA are tax deductible. If you are not entitled to a tax deduction, you may make nondeductible contributions.

Who's eligible?
If you are employed and have earned income, you may currently contribute up to $6,500 (but not more than 100% of your compensation) to a Mutual of America Traditional IRA.

If your spouse is not working, you may be able to establish a spousal IRA and contribute up to an additional $6,500 per year.

Your income and whether or not you or your spouse are active participants in certain tax-qualified retirement plans will determine if you can deduct any, all or part of your IRA contributions from your federal taxes. Learn about tax advantages.

Contribution limits
The annual dollar limitation for 2023 is $6,500, indexed for inflation in $500 increments.

REMINDER: Indexing does not automatically increase the limit each year; increases only apply when the inflation-adjusted limit equals or exceeds the next incremental amount.

Learn more about IRA Contributions & Withdrawals.

Age 50 "catch-up" contributions
Catch-up contributions allow individuals who have reached age 50 to contribute an additional amount to their IRA in that year. In 2023, the catch-up amount is $1,000.

Thus, for example, the IRA contribution limits for 2023 are:

$6,500 for individuals under age 50
$7,500 for individuals age 50 or older

Tax Advantages
Full and partial deductions
There are income thresholds for full deduction of your Traditional IRA contributions and a formula to determine if you can take a partial deduction of your contributions if your income exceeds the limits for full deductions.

If you are a taxpayer with a modified Adjusted Gross Income (AGI)* less than the thresholds listed below, you are entitled to a full deduction of your IRA contributions.

The table below applies to you if:
You are a single taxpayer and an active participant in a retirement plan.
You are a married taxpayer filing jointly, and both you and your spouse are active participants in a retirement plan.
If Your Filing Status Is...	And Your Modified AGI* Is...	Then You Can Take...
single or head of household	$68,000 or less	a full deduction up to the amount of your contribution limit.
single or head of household	more than $68,000 but less than $78,000	a partial deduction.
single or head of household	$78,000 or more	no deduction.
married filing jointly or qualifying widow(er)	$109,000 or less	a full deduction up to the amount of your contribution limit.
married filing jointly or qualifying widow(er)	more than $109,000 but less than $129,000	a partial deduction.
married filing jointly or qualifying widow(er)	$129,000 or more	no deduction.
married filing separately	less than $10,000	a partial deduction.
married filing separately	$10,000 or more	no deduction.
If you file separately and did not live with your spouse at any time during the year, your IRA deduction is determined under the "single" filing status.

Long-term tax advantages
Whether or not you are eligible to deduct all or part of your Traditional IRA contributions from your federal income taxes, all of the interest and/or investment earnings credited to your account accumulate tax-deferred until they are withdrawn. Withdrawals of pre-tax contributions and earnings are subject to income tax at your ordinary income tax rate at the time of withdrawal, and may be subject to a 10% tax penalty, unless taken after reaching age 59½, death, disability or if another exception applies.

Withdrawals
You can withdraw some or all of your Traditional IRA account balance, subject to any applicable taxes. Mutual of America imposes no withdrawal charge. There is a contract fee (unless you elect to receive documents electronically), and investments in the Separate Account investment funds are subject to Separate Account charges and underlying funds investment management fees and expenses. Withdrawals of pre-tax contributions and earnings are subject to income tax at your ordinary income tax rate at the time of withdrawal, and may be subject to a 10% tax penalty, unless taken after reaching age 59½, death, disability or if another exception applies.

What if I want to roll over money from another retirement plan?
When you leave your employer, you may be able to roll your retirement plan savings to a Mutual of America IRA. If you receive a distribution from an IRA, a qualified pension or profit-sharing plan or a tax-deferred annuity plan, you may be able to roll over the distribution to a Mutual of America IRA. Provided the rollover is made within 60 days of the distribution, it will not be currently taxable. Distributions not handled by means of a direct rollover to a Traditional IRA are subject to mandatory 20% federal tax withholding. For more information about rolling over to a new Traditional IRA, refer to the Rollover IRA.

Before rolling over funds from plans with other providers, you should review the accounts you have with them to determine the fees and expenses you currently pay and whether there are any surrender charges that may result and to ensure that it is in your best interest to roll over your other accounts to a Mutual of America IRA.

What are your payment options?
When you are ready to start receiving benefit payments from your account, you have the following options:

Specified Payments Option (SPO) – This option allows you to receive regular monthly payments from your account. The SPO payment amount ($100 minimum) can be changed or stopped at any time.
Annuity – All forms of annuities available under the plan provide a monthly benefit to you for life. The amount of your monthly annuity income will depend on the annuity you select. You may start receiving annuity payments as early as age 55.
Single Sum – You may withdraw your account balance in a single sum.

Spousal IRA
If your spouse has no earned income, you can also contribute up to $6,000* to their IRA. That means that each tax year, you and your spouse can make combined IRA contributions of up to $12,000* per tax year, as long as you do not contribute more than $6,000* to either of your respective IRAs. Income-tax deductibility of spousal contributions to an IRA depends on filing status, Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) and whether or not a spouse is covered by a retirement plan at work. The Spousal IRA application form can be obtained by following the steps to download the Traditional IRA Application Kit.

*You (and your spouse, if applicable) may also make additional contributions if you are age 50 or older. Refer to the Age 50 "catch-up" contributions information.

Why would you consider a Mutual of America Rollover IRA?
If you will be retiring or leaving employment soon, you may want to transfer or "roll over" your assets from a qualified retirement plan to our IRA variable annuity contract. Before rolling over funds from plans with other providers, you should review the accounts you have with them to determine the fees and expenses you currently pay and whether there are any surrender charges that may result and to ensure that it is in your best interest to roll over your other accounts to a Rollover IRA.

If you're retiring
If you will soon be retiring, and you plan to withdraw your money from your employer's pension or retirement plan, you may be able to roll over your benefit to an IRA. An IRA allows you to defer federal income taxes on the rollover amount. Any interest and investment earnings will also accumulate free from federal income taxes until withdrawn. Withdrawals are subject to income tax at your ordinary income tax rate at the time of withdrawal, and if made prior to age 59½, a 10% federal tax penalty unless another exception applies.

If you're leaving your current job
If you're not retiring, but you will soon be leaving your current employer, you may be able to roll over the assets in your current retirement plan to an IRA when you leave. Rolling over your retirement plan assets to an IRA allows you to continue to defer federal income taxes and avoid the 10% early withdrawal penalty if you are under age 59½ or another exception applies. In addition, interest and investment earnings will continue to accumulate free from federal income tax until withdrawn.

If you want to change IRA providers
You can transfer from another Traditional IRA (with another provider) to Mutual of America's IRA and continue to enjoy federal income tax deferral on any interest and investment earnings.

Direct transfers
If you already have a Traditional IRA with another financial institution, you may be able to make a nontaxable direct transfer to a Mutual of America IRA.

Long-term tax advantages
All of the interest and/or investment earnings credited to your account accumulate tax-deferred until they are withdrawn.

Single-sum distributions
If, instead of a direct rollover, you take a single-sum distribution of your retirement assets, 20% will automatically be deducted for mandatory withholding tax. If you're under age 59½, you'll also pay a 10% early withdrawal penalty and regular income tax on the amount received. Provided the rollover is made within 60 days of the distribution, it will not be currently taxable.

A Rollover IRA is a variable annuity contract and is issued on Form 3814-IRA or a similar form specific to your state of residence. In the states of Maine, Oregon and Utah, the variable annuity contract is issued on Form IRA-2004 or a similar form specific to your state of residence. This contract does not provide additional income-tax deferral advantages beyond those available in an IRA. You should carefully consider an annuity contract's other features before making a decision, as well as the potential for a loss of account value due to the Rollover IRA's variable investment choices.

You should consider the investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses of the variable annuity contract and the underlying investment funds carefully before investing. This and other information is contained in the contract prospectus and underlying funds prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained by calling 800.468.3785 or visiting mutualofamerica.com.

What is a Roth IRA?
The Mutual of America Roth IRA is a type of individual retirement variable annuity contract that generally allows you to receive distributions on a tax-free basis. The Roth IRA does not provide up-front income tax deductions for contributions, like there can be with a Traditional IRA. All contributions to a Roth IRA are made on an after-tax basis, but the Roth IRA provides the opportunity for tax-free investment earnings and tax-free distributions if qualified distributions are made.

Unlike other types of IRAs, you are not required to begin taking a distribution at any specific age, and you can continue to make contributions as long as you have earned income, even after age 70½. Mandatory distributions are only required to be made after the death of the Roth IRA contractholder.

Am I eligible for a Roth IRA?
Single taxpayers with a modified Adjusted Gross Income (AGI)* of $138,000 or less in 2023 can contribute up to $6,500 per year.
For single taxpayers with an AGI between $138,000 and $153,000, the maximum allowable contribution to a Roth IRA is proportionately reduced.
Single taxpayers with an AGI of $153,000 or more in 2023 may not contribute.
Married taxpayers filing joint tax returns with a modified AGI of $218,000 or less in 2023 can contribute up to $6,500 each per year, even if only one spouse has compensation.
For married taxpayers filing joint returns with a modified AGI between $218,000 and $228,000 for 2023, the maximum allowable contribution to the Roth IRA is proportionately reduced.
Married taxpayers filing joint returns with an AGI of more than $228,000 in 2023 may not contribute to a Roth IRA.
Married taxpayers filing separate returns cannot contribute to a Roth IRA.
*The modified AGI is used for calculating Roth IRA contribution limits. Please refer to Internal Revenue Code Publication 590 or consult with your tax adviser.

How much may I contribute to a Roth IRA?
The maximum contribution in 2023 is the lesser of $6,500 or 100% of your compensation if you are single, or the lesser of $6,500 for each spouse or 100% of your combined compensation if you are a married couple filing jointly.

Both maximums apply to an individual's total contributions to all Roth IRAs (except rollovers) and are reduced by any contributions you may have made to any other types of IRAs.

The annual dollar limitation increase for 2023 and subsequent years is $6,500, indexed for inflation in $500 increments. Rules limiting Roth IRA contributions based on the modified AGI apply.

REMINDER: Indexing does not automatically increase the limit each year; increases only apply when the inflation-adjusted limit equals or exceeds the next incremental amount.

Age 50 "catch-up" contributions
Catch-up contributions allow individuals who have reached age 50 to contribute an additional amount to their IRA in that year. In 2023, the catch-up amount is $1,000.

Thus, for example, the IRA contribution limits for 2023 are:

$6,500 for individuals under age 50.
$7,500 for individuals age 50 or older.

Is a Roth IRA Right For You?
A number of factors must be considered in deciding if a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA is more advantageous for you. Some factors are:

How long will funds remain in your Roth IRA before being withdrawn?
What tax rate will apply to you when withdrawals are made?
What is the amount of the tax on a conversion of a Traditional IRA and the source from which it is paid?

Converting to a Roth IRA
Can I convert my existing IRA to a Roth IRA?
Under current law, all individuals have the option to convert all or part of their Traditional IRA assets to a Roth IRA. The conversion of assets from a Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA can only be done on a taxable basis. Therefore, ordinary income taxes must be paid on the portion of the "Traditional," or "regular," IRA that is taxable.

As part of the conversion, individuals will have to pay income taxes on the taxable amount, if any, of the Traditional IRA converted to a Roth IRA. The taxable amount includes earnings plus deductible contributions. Additionally, they must decide whether or not to pay the income tax owed on the conversion with the proceeds of the IRA being converted or from another source. Rollovers must also be completed within 60 days of the distribution from the Traditional IRA.

The five-year period for which Roth IRAs must be held before qualified tax-free distributions can be made will apply separately to regular Roth IRA contributions, and to conversions or rollovers to Roth IRAs. Withdrawals from converted or rollover amounts within five years of the conversion or rollover are subject to a penalty tax, even if not taxable. As a result, it is strongly suggested that you avoid commingling regular Roth IRA contributions with conversion/rollover contributions in one tax year with similar contributions in different tax years. It is recommended that a separate Roth IRA be established for each year.

Learn more about Automatic Contributions.

Withdrawals
You can withdraw some or all of your FPA account balance, subject to any applicable taxes. Mutual of America imposes no withdrawal charge.

Turning Your Retirement Savings into Retirement Income
Choosing How and When to Receive Your Retirement Income
You've spent a good part of your working life saving for a secure retirement. Managing your savings to provide the income you will need during retirement requires the same kind of planning for the future.

Mutual of America is ready to help with the assistance you need when you are ready to retire and throughout your retirement years. We can help you make the change from receiving a paycheck, to relying on your savings for retirement income.

Mutual of America offers flexibility and a variety of options for withdrawing your money based on your specific needs for retirement income.

Our Participant Account Representatives and Rollover Specialists can help you review the retirement income options available through a Mutual of America:

Flexible Premium Annuity (FPA)
Individual Retirement Annuity (Traditional IRA)
Roth Individual Retirement Annuity (Roth IRA)
Replacing the steady stream of income from your paycheck requires managing and coordinating the sources of retirement income available to you, including your savings, and any other sources, such as Social Security and employer-sponsored retirement plans. You'll have to consider how and when the income will be paid and estimate the amount of monthly income you will need to live on.

You will also have to make choices that can determine whether your retirement income will last through your retirement years, and if you leave a death benefit for your beneficiaries.

With your retirement savings under the contracts shown above, you can:

Receive a lump-sum payment of your account value or make withdrawals from your contract as you need the money; or
Receive regular monthly payments from your contract with our Specified Payments Option (SPO), and continue to manage and have full access to your retirement savings; or
Choose one of our guaranteed income annuities, to receive a guaranteed monthly income for life, with some options providing death benefits for your beneficiary.
If you choose a guaranteed monthly income for life option, payments under the annuity are guaranteed by, and subject to, the financial strength and claims-paying ability of Mutual of America Life Insurance Company.

No matter which option you choose, you can elect to have your funds paid to you through the security and convenience of electronic funds transfer (EFT).

Important Information Regarding Withdrawals
For an FPA, withdrawals of the tax-deferred interest and any investment earnings are subject to income tax at your ordinary income tax rate at the time of withdrawal, and if made prior to age 59½, a 10% federal tax penalty, unless another exception applies.

For IRAs (except Roth), withdrawals are subject to income tax at your ordinary income tax rate at the time of withdrawal, and if made prior to age 59½, a 10% federal tax penalty, unless another exception applies.

For Roth IRAs, withdrawals of your after-tax contributions are not subject to federal income taxes. And, you won't have to pay federal income taxes on withdrawals of your interest and any investment earnings if taken at least five years after you first contribute to your Roth IRA, and you have attained age 59½; or withdrawals for a qualified first-time home purchase (up to a $10,000 maximum lifetime limit); as a result of your death or disability, or up to $5,000 to pay for expenses related to the birth or adoption of your child.

The Retirement Income Choices Available to You at Mutual of America Are Explained in More Detail Below.
Lump-Sum Payment Option – Choose this option if you would like to receive a single payment of your account value. Or, you can keep your contract in place and elect to make periodic withdrawals as you need the funds.
Specified Payments Option (Your Most Flexible Option) – The Specified Payments Option (SPO) allows you to receive regular monthly payments as an alternative to using your account value to purchase a guaranteed lifetime income annuity once you reach retirement age.
By choosing the Specified Payments Option, you can:

Receive regular monthly payments as withdrawals from your account value, without having to give up control of your savings;
Continue to manage your account value, asset allocations, withdrawals and the timing of your withdrawals for tax purposes;
Name beneficiaries while you maintain your contract and manage your withdrawals, so you can leave your remaining account value to your beneficiaries;
If you qualify, continue to make contributions to your FPA, Roth IRA or Traditional IRA1 while you are receiving payments from the account, to help generate additional income during your retirement or to leave a death benefit for your beneficiaries.2
Choose the Amount and Withdrawal Method of Your SPO Payments

You can choose when to begin, stop or change the amount of your SPO monthly payments of $100 or more at any time. Please note, however, that withdrawals made prior to age 59½ may be subject to a 10% federal tax penalty unless you meet an exception in the tax code.3

SPO payments may be withdrawn on a pro rata basis (proportionately) from the Interest Accumulation Account and/or Separate Account investment fund(s) based on the amount that you have allocated to each at the time of payment. You may also receive your monthly SPO payments from the Interest Accumulation Account and/or investment fund(s) you select. You may change your elections whenever you wish.

We encourage you to sign up for Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) to have your SPO payments deposited directly to your bank account.

You will continue to receive quarterly statements showing all SPO transactions affecting your account, and you can continue to view your account information online at mutualofamerica.com and our mobile site. You also retain the right to transfer amounts among the Interest Accumulation Account and/or investment funds and to change the allocation of your future contributions.

Please note that if you elect the SPO, you reduce the overall account value of the contract from which payments are being withdrawn, and there is no guarantee that you will have sufficient account value to continue payments for any period. Also, individuals should consider the possible federal income tax consequences of electing the SPO.

Guaranteed Lifetime Income Annuities
If you are like many people in or near retirement, you may want the financial security and stability that a guaranteed monthly income for life can provide.

With your Mutual of America annuity, the amount of your guaranteed monthly income is based on your account value at the time you elect a lifetime income annuity, the form of monthly income payments you choose and whether you elect to provide the possibility of a death benefit for your beneficiaries.

Mutual of America offers the following forms of guaranteed lifetime income annuities:
Non-Refund Life Annuity

You will receive monthly payments for life. All payments cease upon your death.
Full Cash Refund Annuity

You will receive monthly payments for life.
If your death occurs before your benefit payments equal your total account value when you began to receive annuity payments, your beneficiary will receive the balance of that value in a single sum.
Life Annuity with Period Certain Annuity

You will receive monthly payments for life.
You may choose a 36-, 60-, 120- or 180-month guarantee. If your death occurs before you have received all of the guaranteed monthly payments as selected, the same monthly benefit will continue to your beneficiary until the total number of payments selected have been made.
Joint and Survivor Life Annuity

You will receive monthly payments for life.
You may choose a survivorship percentage of 50%, 66⅔%, 75% or 100%. After your death, if your joint annuitant is still alive, your joint annuitant will receive monthly payments for life equal to that elected percentage of your original monthly payment amount. Payments will end upon the death of the last survivor.
Joint and Survivor with Period Certain Annuity

You will receive monthly payments for life.
You may choose a survivorship percentage of 50%, 66⅔%, 75% or 100%. After your death, if your joint annuitant is still alive, your joint annuitant will receive monthly payments for life equal to that elected percentage of your original monthly payment amount.
You may also choose a 36-, 60-, 120- or 180-month period certain guarantee. If both you and your joint annuitant die before the period certain elected, your beneficiary will receive monthly payments (in the amount paid to the last surviving annuitant) until the period ends.

All annuity payments are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of Mutual of America Life Insurance Company, which continues to be rated among the strongest companies in the life insurance industry by the major independent rating agencies.4 These current ratings are available at mutualofamerica.com/ratings.

Once your guaranteed lifetime income annuity payments begin, you cannot change your payment form or your joint annuitant. If your monthly annuity benefit would be less than $50 ($20 per month for certain older contracts), we may elect to pay your benefit in a single-sum payment.

We can provide you with an estimate of the guaranteed monthly income you would receive under the various annuity options we offer, to help you choose the one that best meets your needs.

Minimum Distribution Requirements
For all contracts except FPAs and Roth IRAs, IRS regulations require that you begin to receive your retirement benefit no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which you attained age 72.

With a Roth IRA, unlike other types of IRAs, you are not required to begin taking a distribution at any specific age, and you can continue to make contributions as long as you have earned income. Mandatory distributions are only required to be made after the death of the Roth IRA contractholder.

In general, these regulations provide that your entire retirement benefit must be distributed over a period that does not exceed your life expectancy or the joint life expectancy of you and your beneficiary. Please consult with your tax adviser for more information.

Mutual of America's Flexible Premium Annuity (FPA) and Individual Retirement Annuities (IRAs) are individual variable annuity contracts and are suitable for long-term investing, particularly for retirement savings. The value of a variable annuity contract will fluctuate depending on the performance of the Separate Account investment funds you choose. Upon redemption, you could receive more or less than the principal amount invested. A variable annuity contract provides no additional tax-deferred treatment of benefits beyond the treatment provided to any IRA by applicable tax law. You should consider a variable annuity contract's other features before making a decision.

1You can only contribute to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA to the extent you have earned income.↵

2Death benefits from your FPA or IRA are subject to federal and state income tax to the same extent as would be taxable to you.↵

3For an FPA, withdrawals of the tax-deferred interest and any investment earnings are subject to income tax at your ordinary income tax rate at the time of withdrawal, and if made prior to age 59½, a 10% federal tax penalty. For IRAs (except Roth), withdrawals are subject to income tax at your ordinary income tax rate at the time of withdrawal, and if made prior to age 59½, a 10% federal tax penalty. For Roth IRAs, withdrawals of your after-tax contributions are not subject to federal income taxes. And, you won't have to pay federal income taxes on withdrawals of your interest and any investment earnings if taken at least five years after a contribution is made, starting with the year in which a contribution is made, and you have attained age 59½; or withdrawals for a qualified first-time home purchase (up to a $10,000 maximum lifetime limit); or as a result of your death or disability.↵

4While these ratings do not apply to the safety or investment performance of the Separate Account investment funds available under Mutual of America's products, they do reflect the Company's ability to fulfill its General Account obligations, which include its obligations under the Interest Accumulation Account, annuity purchase rate guarantees and annuity benefit payouts, as well as life insurance and disability income payments. Third party ratings are subject to change.↵

Important information about IRA contribution limits.
Your contributions to an IRA are subject to annual limits imposed by the Internal Revenue Code, which may change for future years. (The limits do not apply to rollover contributions, and higher limits apply to employee contributions to a SIMPLE IRA plan offered through an employer.) You should ensure that the automatic contributions you request are within those annual limits for this year, and you should review your automatic contributions at the end of each year to be sure you continue to be eligible and to review the applicable limits for the next year. Additional information, including the limits for the current year, is available on our website for IRAs and Roth IRAs. To more fully understand the tax and planning considerations, including laws specific to your state, you should consult a tax adviser.
